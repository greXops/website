This website is built using Docusaurus 2, a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```sh
username@pcname:~$ yarn
```

## Local Development

```sh
username@pcname:~$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```sh
username@pcname:~$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
